 * reagent atom support has to be added to fractl as a new type, probably :Kernel/Cell
      - this type has to be backed by an "atom" store, indexed by the instance :Id or a
        "name" provided in the attribute definition. if a name is provided like this,
	the atom essentially becomes a global var.
      - define operations on the atom (store) - :set, :reset, :swap and :deref
