* Compile and evaluate queries (start from L93 of fractl/compiler.cljc)

   - the compiler should get the resolver to compile queries (the resolver may in-turn
     delegate this task to the store protocol)

* Integrate the new store and resolver protocols to the init process (exec.cljc).

* Handle TODOs in fractl/compiler/parser.cljc
